CS536 Programming Assignment 4 Solution: Name Analyzer for Wumbo AST
For this assignment you will write a name analyzer for Wumbo programs represented as abstract-syntax trees. Your main task will be to write name analysis methods for the nodes of the AST. In addition you will need to:

Modify the Sym class (by including some new fields and methods and/or by defining some subclasses).

Modify the IdNode class in ast.java (by including a new Sym field and by modifying its unparse method).

Modify P4.java (an extension of P3.java).

Modify the ErrMsg class.

Write two test inputs: nameErrors.wumbo and test.wumbo to test your new code.
